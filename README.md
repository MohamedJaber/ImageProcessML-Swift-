# Image Identifier

## An app that can analyze the image that you take via Camera then give you the name of it and read it for you, and doesn't need internet.

* Used CoreML to identify the objects , and give you the results.
* And used the Vision Too.
* Used AVFoundation to read you the results.


## You can modify one line of code to make it take a pic from The Gallery.

 imagePicker.sourceType = .camera  with 
//imagePicker.sourceType = .photoLibrary

## Here's a screenshot when it working.
